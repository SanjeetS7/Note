# Note
Note is a very basic Windows GUI note app.  It is free, open source, and in the public domain (no copyright).  It uses VBScript and JavaScript with an .HTA interface.

Note relies on a "notes" subfolder in the same directory.  It uses the "options.txt" file to store configuration settings -- currently whether time stamp display is on or off, and what the background color is.
